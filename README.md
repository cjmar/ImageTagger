To use:
Navigate to the config nav link and add folder you wish to use. 
Multiple folders are possible and switching between them is easy.
Go back to the index and can now view images in the folder and add searchable keywords and descriptions.

This software allows for keyword matching and searching of images without altering them in anyway.
Built specifically for a large folder of ancestral/family pictures but can be used for anything.
